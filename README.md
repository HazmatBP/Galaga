#GalagaClone - Harry McGrath, 2022

This is a Galaga inspired game created for a Year 11 school assignment, using python and the PyGame library.
Due to time constraints and the restriction of the project not allowing object oriented code, the game is very far from the initial concept.
However, it does feature a procedurally animated background, custom sound effects and animated player and enemy sprites.

 
##How to Play
Use A and D to move your fighter spacecraft left and right.
Use SPACEBAR to fire a vertical laser at the enemies above you. 

Avoid the projectiles that the enemies will shoot at you!

**Pro Tips:**
- There is a cooldown on the lasers that you fire, so if you wait for a moment between shots, you can shoot 2, or even 3 shots in quick succession!
- Enemies take 2 lasers to kill, and will turn red once hit by one laser.
